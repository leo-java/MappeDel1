Mappe Del 1 
First folder assignment for IDATT2001-Programmering
In this task we focused on the backend for a larger hospital where the goal was to make classes for departments and people related to the hospital
we had less focus on the client side though we've made terminal clients for previous projects
In the way I interpreted this task this client is only a test for the remove method in the Department class and was not supposed to be a functional client with user input
